# UFO_SIGHTINGS


Project Overview
The aim of the project is to build a webpage that has a dynamic table which will provide in-depth analysis of UFO Sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

The criteria that can be filtered for include the following:

-Date
-City
-State
-Country
-Shape


Project Results


To perform a search there are five different criteria to choose from, below are steps to carry out the search:


Step 1
Input the criteria you are looking for. eg if we are searching for the sightings in Oregon (or)(put it in Filter Search tab) and kept all other criteria constant.
Step 2
Press the Enter key after inputting the criteria and a list of results will show up table with five different criteria values mentioned above.


Summary


The drawback of this webpage is the page not able to retain the results from a search once the page is refreshed. 
The refresh returns the page to and the table to the default settings.

Recommendations

-Setup the Element for the State and Country as an Select elements instead of an Un-ordered List elements
-Search results should be retained even when the page is refreshed.
